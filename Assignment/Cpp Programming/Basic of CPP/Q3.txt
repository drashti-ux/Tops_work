What is the difference between OOP and POP?
    POP(Procedural-Oriented Programming):
    1.POP is a programming paradigm where the program is divided into procedures (functions) that operate on data.
    2.Programs are divided into functions or procedures, which perform operations on the data. The functions are separate from the data they operate on.
    3.Functions can be reused, but it’s harder to reuse code since there’s no inheritance or polymorphism.
    4.Top-down approach
    5.Data is less secure, as functions can directly access and modify data without restriction.


    OOP(Object-Oriented Programming):
    1.OOP organizes programs around objects and data rather than actions and logic.
      It uses concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to design modular and reusable code.
    2.Programs are divided into objects, which are instances of classes. Each object contains both data and methods   that operate on the data.
    3.Inheritance and polymorphism support high levels of code reusability.
    4.Bottom-up approach
    5.Encapsulation provides data security by restricting access to data through private and protected access modifiers.
