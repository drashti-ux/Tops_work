What do you understand By Database?
ans:
    A database is an organized collection of structured information or data that is stored and accessed electronically. 
    Databases are designed to manage, store, and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently. 
    They can be structured to allow data to be organized in rows and columns (as in relational databases), stored in a more flexible format (as in NoSQL databases), or optimized for different use cases like document storage, graph-based data, etc.
